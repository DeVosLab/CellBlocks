# CellBlocks
ImageJ/Fiji macro set dedicated to in silico cytometric decomposition analysis. Flexible high content analysis to measure descriptive features about cell and nucleus as well as intracellular objects. Demands a nuclear channel to facilitate segmentation of individual nuclei and conditional expansion to segment cellular regions of influence. A variety of visualization and correction tools is available.
